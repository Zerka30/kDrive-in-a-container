# üìÅ Docker WebDAV Mounter for Infomaniak KDrive

This Docker image facilitates the mounting of an Infomaniak KDrive WebDAV space into a container, providing a simple solution for accessing and managing your KDrive documents.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Docker image, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Docker installed on your system.
- A valid Infomaniak KDrive account with the necessary access credentials (email, password, and ID).
- Familiarity with Docker concepts and basic usage.

## Configuration

1. **Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zerka30/kDrive-in-a-container
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd kDrive-in-a-container
    ```

3. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t kdrive-container .
    ```

4. **Set your KDrive credentials in the environment variables:**

    ```bash
    export KDRIVE_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
    export KDRIVE_PASSWORD="your_kdrive_password"
    export KDRIVE_ID="your_kdrive_id"
    ```

5. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash

    ```

## Usage

The Docker container will automatically mount your KDrive space to the `/mnt/kdrive` directory inside the container. To access your KDrive documents, you can either enter the container or map the `/mnt/kdrive` directory to a local directory on your host machine.

```bash
docker exec -it kdrive-mount /bin/bash
```

Feel free to adapt and customize the configuration according to your needs. Remember to secure your environment variables and adjust permissions accordingly for sensitive information.
